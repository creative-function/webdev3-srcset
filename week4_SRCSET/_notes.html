SRCSET (source set):
    1. allows you to playce multiple image sources in an image tag
    2. allows you to change resolution only
    3. lets the browser decide which image would be the best to load

    EXAMPLE:

        <img srcset="imageA-1x.jpg 1x, imageA-2X.jpg 2x," src="imageA-1x.jpg">
            we want imageA to load (hence why we still set it as the src image aka the default)
            we have two types, imageA-1x.jpg at 1x resolution(aka 1x= density) and imageA-2x.jpg at 2x resolution aka density.
            *seperate images by comma*
            *a single typo will invalide the srcset*

DENSITY
    1X,2X,ETC
    is used on *FIXED WIDTH IMAGES ONLY*, only for if you want to mess with the resolution, not the size.

FLUD WIDTH 

    using fluid width, we can define the width of srcset images. 
    EXAMPLE

    <img srcset="flowers-small.jpg 480w,
                 flowers-medium.jpg 720w, 
                 flowers-large.jpg 1200w" 
        sizes="100vw"
        src="flowers-large.jpg"> 
SIZES

    sizes attribute specifies width of image on page. Can use this to define column layout changes

    <img sizes="(min-width: 640px) 50vw, 100vw, etc" ...="">
         can use SIZES to set breakpoints or view width 


PICTURE * use sparingly *
    builds off of srcset
    a stricter control over when you display certain images
        1, use for art direction    
        2. use for multiple image formats (i.e webp or other special formats different from .png,.jpg,etc)
        3. browser has little to no conrol (unline srcset)
        4. *use sparingly* brower cannot control this setting
    
    EXAMPLE:
    <picture class="header-splash">
            <source media="(max-width:960px)" srcset="dist/img/macbook-header.jpg">
            <source media="(min-width:960px)" srcset="dist/img/macbook-alt.jpg">
            <img src="dist/img/macbook-header.jpg">
     </picture>

    


IMAGE FORMATS
     browser uses first image format it recognizes

     EXAMPLE:
     <picture>
            <source srcset="dist/img/castle.webp" type="image/webp"> /*special image will be used unless browser has issue*/
            <source srcset="dist/img/castle.jpg" type="image/jpg">  /*jpg image will be used next if recognized by broswer*/
            <img src="dist/img/castle.jpg"> /*default*/
     </picture>

QUESTIONS:
    Chelsea-
         Why is macaron1280.jpg stil stretching? we tried align-items, align-self, display:block, etc. 
         edit: seenms to be stretching on chrome, not firefox

    Jasmin-

     When sizing fluid width, do we tell it what size the image is or what size we want it to be?
